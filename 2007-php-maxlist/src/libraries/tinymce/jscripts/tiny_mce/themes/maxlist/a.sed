#< Remove C/C++ comments from files
# Another way to do it - adapted from a script found here

# to allow c++ // style comments to be removed

# If pattern is not matched (i.e. line does not contain /*
# then branch to label :c

# Okay - line must contain /*, or we've branched here
# if line doesn't contain */ then append contents of next line to
# pattern space and continue - we must have got here by a branch
# to :a (or start of comment), so we can assume we're 
# processing a comment

# okay - not multiline comment - could be code, or single line
